# Dublin-Noise

This is analysis of data collected by noise monitoring equipment in Dublin, Ireland. The data is available at the following link:

http://dublincitynoise.sonitussystems.com/applications/api/api-doc.html

The data currently contains noise levels at 14 locations in Dublin.

It is an exercise to improve my knowledge in API usage. Intention is to complete a dashboard and initial analysis before looking at ARIMA models to predict noise levels.
